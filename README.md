# Salt_Pepper_using_MERN_stack

<h3> Project Description: </h3>
<p>
Salt and Pepper is an Online Recipe Sharing Platform with the most unique feature which
addresses the problem of not being able to get all the ingredients of the given recipe at
once. Our website is a cross-over between a recipe sharing portal and an e-commerce,
which shall provide all the ingredients with respect to a recipe at once, this is very helpful
for many home-cooks as they usually don't find all the ingredients in their neighbourhood.
User also has an option to buy only a set of ingredients among the total ingredients of that
recipe. Other features of the website include: User can follow specific cuisines , people
with similar interests, advanced search which would allow user to seek recipes based on
ingredients searched. Our recipe sharing / E-commerce is different from others because it
will suggest recipes of dishes which are famous in the userâ€™s current location. These
suggestions might also be influenced by any festivals or any special holiday/ occasion
which is being celebrated in that part of the area where the user currently resides in.

<h5>
Background:
</h5>
<p>
It is generally not very convenient for chefs and cooks to gather all the ingredients of a
recipe, our service will however provide them facility to buy them all at once.
</p>

<h5>
Purpose:
</h5>
<p>
Recipe sharing websites do not come with facility to buy ingredients there itself, so our
website is an E-commerce / recipe sharing portal where home-cooks and chefs can buy
all the ingredients at once.
</p>

<h5>
Interfaces to External Systems:
</h5>
<p>
We aim to build a separate interface for dealers who supply the ingredients of our recipes
where they can check for ingredients which are in need according to supply and demand.

Data Requirements:
</h5>
<p>
We are using mongoDB, which is a NOSQL database. This is not a relational model.
Hence an entity Relationship model is not possible. Mongo stores data in JSON format.
